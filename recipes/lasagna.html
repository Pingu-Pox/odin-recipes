        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A delicious lasagna made with a meaty sauce and creamy bechemel!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 Onion</li>
            <li>1 Celery Stock</li>
            <li>1 Carrot</li>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1LB Ground Beef</li>
            <li>1LB Ground Pork (or sausage)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Oregano</li>
            <li>1c Chicken Stock</li>
            <li>28oz Crushed Tomatoes (recommend Cento brand)</li>
            <li>28oz Water</li>
            <li>1/2c Salted Butter</li>
            <li>1/4c All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 3/4c Milk</li>
            <li>1 pinch Nutmeg</li>
            <li>
                2x boxes Oven-Ready Lasagna Pasta Sheets (suggest getting a few
                boxes, as how many youâ€™ll use will depend on how much of the
                sauces you use in each layer.)
            </li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese (1 large block grated)</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese (grated)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Finely dice 1 whole onion, 1 stock of celery, and 1 medium
                carrot, and then chop it even finer in a food processor (carrots
                first, then add celery, then add onion). This makes an italian
                soffritto.
            </li>
            <li>
                In stock pot, heat olive oil. Once simmering, add your soffritto
                and heat for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once soffritto is heated through, add 1 pound of ground beef and
                1 pound of ground pork, season with salt, pepper and oregano.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once meat is cooked through, add 1 cup of chicken stock or white
                wine. Simmer for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add your large can of crushed tomatoes 28oz, and then fill the
                empty can with 28oz of filtered water, stir and then bring up to
                heat. Simmer for 1 hour minimum. The longer the better.
            </li>
            <li>
                Once sauce has reduced and made beautiful flavors. In a separate
                pan heat 1/2 cup of butter until melted, then add 1/4 cup of
                flour, cook for 4-5 minutes stirring regularly. Then add two 1
                3/4 cups of milk, and heat on low until thickened, add salt,
                pepper and nutmeg. Then turn off heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                We use foil baking pans for this part, but casserole dishes work
                too. Assemble your lasagna, sauce first, then cheese, then
                bechemel, then pasta sheets, then start over until you've filled
                the dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Then heat in the oven covered for 30 minutes, then uncovered for
                15, take cool and enjoy.
            </li>
        </ol>
