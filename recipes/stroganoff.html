        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The best and fastest stroganoff you will ever have!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>2 pounds ribeye steak, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>

            <li>1 diced onion</li>
            <li>3 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>
                3 cups low sodium beef broth (can add more if a small amount
                remains)
            </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 (12-ounce) package wide egg noodles</li>
            <li>1/2 - 3/4 cup sour cream (can be done to taste)</li>
            <li>
                2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley leaves (optional, I just
                garnish with more black pepper)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set a 6-qt Instant Pot to the high sauté setting.</li>
            <li>
                Season beef with salt and pepper, to taste. Heat olive oil;
                working in two batches, add beef and cook until evenly browned,
                about 3-4 minutes; set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add garlic, onion and thyme. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
                tender, about 3-4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Whisk in flour until lightly browned, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>
                Stir in beef broth and scrape bits off bottom, Worcestershire
                and beef.
            </li>
            <li>
                Select manual setting; adjust pressure to high, and set time for
                12 minutes. When finished cooking, quick-release pressure
                according to manufacturer’s directions.
            </li>
            <li>Stir in egg noodles.</li>
            <li>
                Select manual setting; adjust pressure to high, and set time for
                5 additional minutes. When finished cooking, quick-release
                pressure according to manufacturer’s directions.
            </li>
